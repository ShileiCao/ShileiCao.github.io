I'm a first-year master student from [IGCS Lab](https://rssysu.github.io/) of [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Zheng](https://rssysu.github.io/assets/resume/zjp.html). I also spent some time at the [HPGC research group](http://www.thuhpgc.net/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page) of Tsinghua University  as a visiting student, supervised by [Prof. Fu](https://www.thuhpgc.net/mediawiki/index.php/Haohuan_Fu). During my undergraduate studies, I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Peng](http://zhenhuipeng.com/). My current research interest includes:
1. Transfer learning for Vision Models
   - 11
- AI for Science
1. 正确缩进
   - 子项缩进 2 空格
 
You can find my [CV](../assets/ShileiCao_CV.pdf) here.
