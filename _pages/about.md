I'm a third-year undergraduate student from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) with a major in Artificial Intelligence. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Peng](http://zhenhuipeng.com/) of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Lab from [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://sai.sysu.edu.cn/), Sun Yat-sen University. My research interest includes Deep Learning (e.g., Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision), Machine Learning, Human-Computer Interaction and its intersection with Artificial Intelligence.
